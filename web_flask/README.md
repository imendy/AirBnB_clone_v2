## AirBnB clone - Web framework


Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Web Framework built with Flask. This repository provides a Python-based web framework to create your own AirBnB-like accommodation rental platform. Flask is a lightweight and versatile web framework that makes it easy to develop web applications and APIs. This README will guide you through various aspects of this project, from understanding web frameworks to working with Flask and connecting to a MySQL database.

## What is a Web Framework?

A web framework is a pre-built software framework that simplifies web development. It provides a structured foundation for building web applications, including tools, libraries, and conventions to streamline the development process. Flask is one such web framework for Python that helps in creating web applications efficiently.

## Building a Web Framework with Flask

To build a web framework with Flask, you will need to set up a Flask project. You can do this by creating a Flask application and organizing your code in a structured manner. You can refer to the Flask documentation for more details on project setup.

## Defining Routes in Flask

In Flask, routes are URL patterns that map to specific functions in your application. These functions handle incoming HTTP requests and generate responses. You define routes using decorators, such as `@app.route('/example')`, where `/example` is the URL path.

## Handling Variables in a Route

You can handle variables in Flask routes by including placeholders in the route's URL pattern. For example, `@app.route('/user/<username>')` allows you to access the `username` variable as a parameter in the corresponding function. This dynamic routing enables you to create flexible and dynamic web applications.

## Understanding Templates

Templates in web development are files that contain the structure and layout of HTML pages. These files can include placeholders for dynamic content, such as variables and loops. Flask uses a templating engine called Jinja2 to render these templates dynamically.

## Creating an HTML Response in Flask with Templates

To create an HTML response in Flask using a template, you need to render the HTML using Jinja2. This typically involves passing data from your Python code to the template and rendering the template with the data to produce an HTML response.

## HTML/CSS Files
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator (except for jinja template)
All your CSS files should be in the styles folder
All your images should be in the images folder
You are not allowed to use !important or id (#... in the CSS file)
All tags must be in uppercase
Current screenshots have been done on Chrome 56.0.2924.87.
No cross browsers
More Info
Install Flask
$ pip3 install Flask

```
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/example')
def example_route():
    data = "Hello, World!"
    return render_template('template.html', data=data)
```

## Creating Dynamic Templates

You can create dynamic templates in Flask by incorporating conditional statements, loops, and template inheritance. Jinja2 provides a powerful syntax to handle these dynamic elements within your HTML templates.

## Displaying Data from a MySQL Database

To display data from a MySQL database in your Flask application, you will need to establish a connection to the database and execute SQL queries. You can use libraries like `mysql-connector-python` or an ORM like SQLAlchemy to interact with the database. Retrieve the data and pass it to your templates for rendering.

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish a database connection
db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(user='user', password='password', host='localhost', database='database_name')

# Execute SQL queries and retrieve data
cursor = db_connection.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM your_table')
data = cursor.fetchall()

# Pass the data to a template for rendering
return render_template('template.html', data=data)
```

Make sure to properly handle database connections, error handling, and security when working with databases.
